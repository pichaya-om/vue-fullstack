    "lyrics": "He asked me for his Iron Maiden shirt back\nIt crushed me, 'cause it was the best one I had\nTell me why it's gotta be this way, why it's gotta be this way\nWhat did I do, what did I say?\nI'm fighting like crazy, 'cause things ain't the same\nJames has changed\nHe don't want me anymore\nI feel strange, he don't love me like he did before\nIt's a shame, 'cause my James was all I had\nAnd he's not even sad\nI don't care if he's not the right one for me, no\n'Cause sometimes the wrong ones are just what you need (I wish you'd tell me)\nTell me what are you supposed to do, what are you supposed to do\nWhen he won't even look at you\nIt kills me, I wish it was killing him, too\nJames has changed\nHe don't want me anymore\nI feel strange, he don't love me like he did before\nIt's a shame, 'cause my James was all I had\nAnd he's not even sad\nJames has changed\nHe don't want me anymore\nIt's insane, 'cause he wanted me so bad before\nIt's a shame, 'cause my James don't even cry\nAnd he won't tell me why\nWe used to have fun together\nWe used to be dumb together\nBut now I'm just dumb and all alone\nI gave you my heart forever\nSuddenly you're so whatever\nYou want your shit back\nBut you should know\nI'll never let it go\nJames has changed\nHe don't want me anymore\nI feel strange, he don't love me like he did before\nIt's a shame, 'cause my James was all I had\nAnd he's not even sad\nJames has changed\nHe don't want me anymore\nIt's insane, 'cause he wanted me so bad before\nIt's a shame, 'cause my James don't even cry\nAnd he won't tell me why",
